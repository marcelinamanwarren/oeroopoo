 Игра Counter-Strike 1.6, которую геймеры позже стали называть «контра», имела массу недостатков, но стоило обновить релиз в 2000 году, как в первую неделю, после старта продаж, пользователи купили. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive — многопользовательская компьютерная игра в жанре трёхмерного шутера. I'm so fucking bored of playing games. I have 3000 hours on counter-strike, 2000 on css, 1000 on gmod, 200+ on all cods but can't play them without feeling sick anymore. I haven't touched my PC in 4 months. I love solo player storyline games like the old uncharted's, Far Cry series, Assassins Creed's and Hitmen. Can anyone recommend some games that I'll enjoy. Представьте себе ситуацию. Собирается команда разработчиков, обладающая определенным и далеко самым большим бюджетом. Natural Selection (mod) ( (2002) Natural Selection 2 ( (2012) Gap: 10 years. Standalone development time: 6 years ----- Team Fortress (mod) ( (1996) Team Fortress 2 ( (2007) Gap: 11 years. Standalone development time: 9 years ----- Defense of the Ancients (mod) (http://en.wiki. Hej r/gaming I need your help. I'm looking for an old counter strike video. What I can remember that it was a guy playing counter strike in his room. He is having some ups and downs while playing and right as he lands a headshot the song "The one and only" by Chesney Hawkes kicks in and he has this epic run. Anybody remember that or more details about the video that would help me find it? Cheers. I enjoy quake, but I would like to see more fps that can be sideloaded. I would love to see something along the lines of Counter Strike (2000) or the original Halo (2001). I am hoping that more advancements will be made in this area since the Oculus store apparently doesn't enjoy free movement. Anyone know how tough it was to port Quake? Is it reasonable 
It's around the early 2000s where it was a video in the early days of Youtube. Basically, it was a series of Counter-Strike players performing tricks while techno music was blasting in the background. It was mostly in the De\_Dust map. They could have been hacking to get the "shots" they wanted. I believe it was a series of headshots through awps, and just a constant barrage of outlandish shooting kills or knife kills. It might have also possibly ended with the video where a mass group CS: Source, Counter-Strike (2000), Condition Zero, etc all had M4 Carbine capable of adding on a silencer. You could choose between Silenced or Non-Silenced. Buying a whole different M4 is pointless. Why not switch the M4A1 with the M4A4 so we don't have to add another gun to the menu. It just seems like such an oversight by Valve. Also, adding custom items and unlockables reminds me of League of Legends, DOTA 2, etc. Micro-transactions dilute the game for me. It doesn't feel natural winnin. Pretty incredible. Who plays original counter strike still? Also Civ 5 has more players Platform(s):PC Genre: First Person Shooter Game Estimated year of release: Late 1990s- Early 2000s Graphics/art style: Counter Strike graphics Notable gameplay mechanics: Seems like a Counter Strike single player mod set in an Egyptian desert, with a pyramid and an Egyptian Sphinx. Other details: Icon of game had the original Counter Strike. Platform(s): Pc Genre:FPS Estimated year of release: Early 2000 Graphics/art style: Similar to CS 1.6 Notable characters: Similar to CS 1.6 Notable gameplay mechanics: Very similar to CS 1.6 Other details: Long time ago i played a game that was VERY similar to CS 1.6 with the same shop system, typical plant bomb modes, Terrorists vs Anti Terrorist and i belive it was in the source engien to but i can't remember the name on it, somtheing something operation  i do belive. As the title says, it was kind of a CS 1.6 clone. The only map I remember is a mansion/house of sorts. I picked it up back when Bigbond Game Rentals was a thing, but that service no longer exists and google has basically removed everything related I remember it being a flash game that looked a lot like Counter-Strike 2D, but with simpler graphics. It included a level editor and you could kick the bodies of enemies you killed. It was quite graphic despite it's blocky aesthetics. The level editor was also simple and included various objects and pick-ups which were essentially just square ammo boxes with icons on them. I'm fairly sure it was primarily single-player. Extra #1: During a classic competitive game, how do I private message my teammate or my opponent? How do I look at their rank during a match, or their last sets of games, etc? Extra #2: How do I talk in typing to my team? I know Y is to all, but I thought T was for team? Extra #3: How do I surrender a game, and at what point can I surrender a game? Extra #4: How do I take a screenshot while in CS: GO? Print screen didn't work. 1. Why am I paired up with people who don't speak my language. 
Selling a Counter Strike (CS GO) Steam Account (DMG, 2000+ hours, 800 wins, 3 year account). Price is  (by PayPal). Thanks. Is there anything like this now a days? I was seriously into Counter-Strike back before Source came out, and CAL was jam packed with clans and the competitiveness was amazing. I used to have so much fun practicing map strategies with my clan and honing in my skills. I do see a lot of posts about CS:GO, is there a similar presence in that game? Do you still see gaming leagues like CAL, or has it become more casual? Thanks Platform(s): PC Genre: Multiplayer FPS, I believe this was CS 1.0 or 1.6 Estimated year of release: 2000 Graphics/art style: FPS Notable characters: Terrorists/Anti-terrorists Notable gameplay mechanics: Deathmatch First Person Shooter Other details: So I'm actually looking to find an old map that I played on Counter Strike years ago. It was a custom map, so who knows how to find it, but it was a huge maze of wooden crates. Like tall enough that they could not be jumped up onto. The notabl. </p>
